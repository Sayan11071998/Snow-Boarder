# üèÇ Snow-Boarder üéÆ

## Highlights

- **Smooth Snowboarder Controls**  
  Implemented precise movement using Rigidbody2D and Torque to create realistic rotation and jumping mechanics.

- **Dynamic Snow Environment**  
  Built with EdgeCollider2D and Surface Effector2D to simulate smooth sliding and realistic snow friction.

- **Obstacle Avoidance**  
  Designed challenging slopes where players must dodge obstacles to survive and maximize their score.

- **Handcrafted Slopes**  
  Created engaging tracks with thoughtfully placed obstacles to continuously test player skills.

- **Dynamic Camera System**  
  Used Cinemachine‚Äôs Follow Camera for a seamless, immersive player experience.

- **Visual & Audio Effects**  
  Added particle effects (snow spray) and sound effects (jumps, landings, collisions) to enhance gameplay feel.

## Key Learnings

- Strengthened Unity and C# skills with a focus on 2D physics and player control mechanics.
- Improved level design techniques for building dynamic, engaging environments.
- Mastered advanced Unity components like EdgeCollider2D, Surface Effector2D, and Cinemachine.
- Gained experience integrating particle systems and audio for greater player immersion.
- Deepened understanding of scripting for collision detection, physics interaction, and game state control.
